Users can stake tokens using the `stake` function.\n2. Users can unstake tokens using the `unstake` function, subject to a cooldown period.\n3. Users can claim rewards using the `claimRewards` function.\n4. The contract owner can update the reward rate using the `updateRewardRate` function.\n5. The contract includes security measures like ReentrancyGuard and Ownable.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract uses a placeholder address for the staking token. You should replace this with the actual token address before deployment.\n2. The reward calculation is simplified and may not be suitable for all use cases. You might want to adjust it based on your specific requirements.\n3. The contract assumes that the staking token has sufficient decimals to handle the reward calculations accurately.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Replace the placeholder token address in the constructor with your actual token address.\n2. Ensure that the staking token contract has approved this contract to spend tokens on behalf of users.\n3. Users need to approve the contract to spend their tokens before staking.\n4. The contract owner should carefully manage the reward rate and ensure the contract has enough tokens to pay out rewards.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider a professional audit before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
